# Zoom Recordings To Google Drive

This code automate the process of downloading Zoom meeting recordings for a specific meeting, identified by its meeting_id, and then upload the recording files to a Google Drive folder.

## Recommendations
To save time and streamline the process, I suggest running the script in Google Colab and omitting the step of uploading the downloaded files to Google Drive.
